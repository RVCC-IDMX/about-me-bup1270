Hello. It's me Ismael Velez. Welcome to my About Me project. In this project, I created my very first and big Website. Creating this website was very challenging and very fun. This project made me expand my creative mind to different things. Many things like the color. The colors I chose for the look of the page are #1f9c6b (Dark cyan - lime green), #30c6e6 (Bright cyan), and #006400 (Very dark lime green). When creating this website. I learned many new skills and expanded on skills I already knew. Some skills I was already familiar with were HTML coding. Much of the coding was stuff I learned online, or from a professor. But I learned more than expanded. Many new things I learned were CSS coding. I never knew people needed to use many different coding languages to create the website they have in their minds. Many things creating this page were learned or expanded. But in the end, this project was a very good test of my skills and creative mind. I can take many things from this project and from what I learned from it. With it, I can create more websites that can tailor to my vision when I learn more and more as time goes on and I continue to experiment around with coding.
