Hello. Its me Ismael Velez. Welcome to my About Me project. In this project, I created my very first and big Website. Creating this website was very challanging and very fun. This project made me expand my creative mind for different things. Many things like the color. The colors I chose for the look of the page is #1f9c6b (Dark cyan - lime green) and #30c6e6 (Bright cyan). When creating this website. I learned many new skills and expanded on skills I already knew. Some skills I was alrady fimailer with were some of the HTML coding. Many of the coding was stuff I learned from online, or from a professor. But I learned more than expanded. Many new things I learned was the CSS coding. I never knew people needed to use many different coding languages to create the website they have in their mind. Many things creating this page was learend or expanded. But in the end, this project was a very good test on my skills and creative mind.
