        <h2>Evelina</h2>

        <div>
            
            <p>As I held it in my hand, Sir Clement teazed me to look at it immediately; and told me, the reason he could not produce the lines publicly was, that among the ladies who were mentioned, and supposed to be rejected, was Lady Louisa Larpent. I am much concerned at this circumstance, as I cannot doubt but that it will render me more disagreeable to her than ever, if she should hear of it.</p>

            <p>I will now copy the verses, which Sir Clement would not let me rest till I had read.</p>

            <p>See last advance, with bashful grace, Downcast eye, and blushing cheek, Timid air, and beauteous face, Anville,-whom the Graces seek. Though ev'ry beauty is her own, And though her mind each virtue fills, Anville,-to her power unknown, Artless strikes,-unconscious kills. I am sure, my dear Sir, you will not wonder that a panegyric such as this should, in reading, give me the greatest confusion; and, unfortunately, before I had finished it, the ladies returned.</p>

            <p>"What have you there, my dear?" said Mrs. Selwyn.</p>

            <p>"Nothing, Ma'am," said I, hastily folding, and putting it in my pocket.</p>

            <p>"And has nothing," cried she, "the power of rouge?"</p>
