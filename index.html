        <h2>Blog Article</h2>

        <div>
            
            <p>This is a blog about how this About Me project came to be the way it is! This project was a very big effort project that really made me think creatively about how many things should come out to look. A very big impact this project made me think around about is the Netlify Large Media Format. This kind of format made me expand my mind more on how many people not only need some support when hosting a web page. But it also can help them take care of the hard parts so they can focus on the more important parts of their projects. With the Netlify Large Media Format, it allows the creator to connect their progress from GIT so when they are ready to post. You can just save and let the program do the work for you.</p>

            <p>Many programmers use different tools to allow their work to be up to date when they save or do anything. But many miss the chance to be more efficient in their work. With the Format, this helps programmers keep all their work up to date and post as soon as possible to the public, without the hassle of waiting for servers to catch back up with each other.</p>
            
            <p>Using Netlify Large Media Format has allowed me to leave a big chunk of work to the computer to take care of for me. With the computer taking care of a big part of work that would be very time consuming and difficult, it allows me to keep working on the important parts of the project. While I'm working on the project. Netlify is also working on the project in the background. With me making edits and or changes. It's also keeping me up to date with my changes and saving them. So when I'm ready to post the changes, Netlify already has a copy from GIT to just post online. This really made my work so much easier allowing me to focus on the creative and coding parts of the project.</p>
            
            <p>With the idea of having a program making all the hard work taken care of. There are many different kinds of programs that can do that. But with programs, they can use some of your computer resources. But with plugins, it will run when it's needed. Not only will it use the least amount of time. It would be able to be more efficient with nothing interfering with it. Many things have been made to be similar to Netlify Large Media Formant. But many of that kinds of programs or plugins have many drawbacks. A big one would be it could cost money to even use it. Another drawback would be it could also have bloat on it causing your computer rescores to be used more than it needs to be. But with the Netflix Large Media Formant. It allows you to paste it on your HTML and allow it to work on its own without bothering the author.</p>
